                           Hello! My name is Daniel Kondor, and I recently graduated from Wilfrid Laurier University with a Bachelor of Computer Science. 
                           Throughout the last several years, I have learned several languages and developed a keen interest in back and front-end programming and algorithms. 
                           I am passionate about working collaboratively with others to create new projects which allows me to gain new and valuable knowledge from these experiences. 
                           I value new opportunities to connect with others and to continue my learning journey.
                           <br><br>
                           During a summer internship, I worked for OPC Expert and created a program to stream multiple screens to one using TCP Protocols and Threading techniques which they continue to use. 
                           More recently, I have been working on a program that utilizes Telegram Bots, and threading to assist a company with streamlining the process for employees to book time off.
                           <br><br>
                           Outside of work, I spend my time working on personal projects, recreational cycling, playing guitar, or spending time with friends.
                           <br><br>
                           Thank you for reading, and please reach out over email if you would like to connect!
